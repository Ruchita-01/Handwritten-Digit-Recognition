# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This is our DataScience Mini- project done by my team for DataScience Domain.
Handwritten Digit Recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits.

## What is our Project about?
A model can be developed to recognize the human handwritten digits effectively. To predicts the actual handwritten digit considering the shape and the images of the same.
We have used CNN and Python for the model building. 
Used MINIST dataset for the data.
Frontend was build using Tkinter i.e white canvas.

Software Used: Visual Studio Code
